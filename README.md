## Project Title

Staple

## What and Why?

Staple would essentially be a food distribution application based mainly on mobile. The main objective of Staple would be to counter food waste by providing an efficient (but simple) means by which extra food would reach the needy. This food would otherwise most likely go to waste. There would be another feature on the app which would enable restaurants to affiliate with Staple after which food left at the end of the day, like cakes or biscuits at bakeries, could be sold for less to people, benefitting both the restaurants and the customers, and at the same time tackling food waste.

The idea behind Staple was inspired by the tremendously large amounts of food waste I would see back home, be it from parties, weddings, restaurants, or even my own household. At the same time, I would also see people around me who were genuinely in need of that food but there was practically no means by which this eventually-wasted food could reach them. I saw as time progressed, the number of people in need increased, but at the same time, the amount of food waste also grew, so I thought I’d propose an idea for an app that would hopefully connect these dots.


## For Whom?

Staple is intended to be made for people who do not have the means to buy their own food, and it could also work as a relief in times of crisis. The main objective of the app is to make food available for pick up to people who face hunger. These poeple will be the “beneficiaries”, the donors will be the other (very important) users involved who will essentially be able to donate food via the app from their doorstep and earn “Staple Credits” (virtual credits on the app) for doing so. These credits can then be used to dine at one of Staple’s own restaurants or be used as discounts in one of Staple’s partner restaurants (the ones where people buy food for less at the end of the day).


## How?

The user (donor) would start by giving a quote of the quantity of items ready to be available for pickup by one of Staple’s riders. The rider would then transport food from the donor’s doorstep to one of Staple’s storage + distribution facilities (called Staple Centers). Here, the donated food would be stored and people in need would arrive at these locations to pick up food. A feature would also be available on the app where users can check the current availability of food at any of these centers before going to collect it. Rider tracking would also be present so that donors can have an idea of the ETA for the rider’s arrival. 

The food donors would get Staple Credits in return. These credits would essentially be redeemable for discounts at partner restaurants and can be used at one of Staple’s own restaurants for dine-in. So essentially, people who donate would be able to dine better by giving away extra food. If enough affiliations are made, Staple Credits could even be used at other shops like grocery stores, fashion stores etc in return for discounts, affiliations such as these would benefit stores by letting the public know that they are supporting a good cause.


## Scope

The proposal is a bit ambitious since it talks about restaurants, riders, and storage facilities that would not exist at the time of the App’s creation. However, none of the features outlined above are particularly new, so their implementation should not cause a lot of panic. The special thing about Staple would be the way it ties these features together into a system that would benefit every party associated with the application.
